# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Deployed app link
https://personal-notekeeper.netlify.app/login

### How this project made?

I have created a MERN project. Where I used react.js for my frontend side.
For backend, I used node.js, express.js and mongoDB. 
I have also implemented authentication and authorization for using this app.
Here I have also written the logic of validation where form will validate the given input.

### What this project does

In this app, we can store our daily basis important tasks and personal notes.
We need to signup first then it will redirect to home page where we can see the UI for storing daily tasks.

### Here is the video of my project.
